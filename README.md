This repository consists of seperate tasks, as one line problem statements. 
Specific questions underlying the problem statement along with the code is available in the form of Jupyter Notebook.

- #### To Explore Supervised Machine Learning: <br /> 
   1. Using Simple Linear Regression: *study_hours.ipynb*<br/>
      > **Task**: In this regression task we ought to predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the
                  number of hours they studied. 
                  Data for the same can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data <br/>
- #### To Explore Unsupervised Machine Learning: <br /> 
   1. Using Decision Trees: *Iris_DT.ipynb* <br /> 
      > **Task**: From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of
                  clusters and represent it visually.

   2. Using K Means Clustering: *Iris_KMC.ipynb*
      > **Task**: For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and
                  visualize it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this
                  classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.

 - #### To Explore Business Analytics: *Sample Superstore.ipynb*<br />
      > **Task**: Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on the dataset, '*Sample Superstore.ipynb*'.<br/>
                  As the business owner of a retail firm, see how your company is performing.
                  Find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit.
                  Derive the solution to all business problems by looking into the data.<br/>
